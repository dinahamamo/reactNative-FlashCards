# Mobile Flash Cards
A React Native mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
It helps and notifies users to study everyday. Where one can add a deck with an unlimited number of questions, they can then access all their saved decks.

Each deck is a quiz-like process, where questions appear on the screen without the correct answer; not until the user reveals it. Then they can mark their correct and incorrect answers to calculate their final scores.

Upon quiz submission, users can reset their score and re-take the quiz.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

```
npm install -g create-react-native-app
```

This App was developed and tested for OS.
iOS apps can only be developed on a Mac unless you have a virtual machine set up on your machine. To set up the iPhone simulator on your Mac, follow these instructions:

* Go to the App Store.
* Download Xcode.
* Follow the installation instructions.
* Open Xcode and install additional software if prompted to do so.

**If you already have Xcode installed, please make sure that you update it. Then, open it to make sure no further updates are needed. Most problems with setting up your React Native development environment can be solved this way.**

* Open Xcode and go to "Preferences."
* Go to the "Locations" panel and select the most recent version in the "Command Line Tools" drop-down list.
* Thatâ€™s it!

### Installing
```
npm install
npm start
```
After starting the app, you can choose either to view it on the simulator - press i, or on your mobile phone - scan the QR code.
